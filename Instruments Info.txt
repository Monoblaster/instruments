Note format:
(Letter a-g)[# or S for sharp](Octave 3-6)[:(0.200-2.000) Manual tuning]
For example "as5:0.500". An a-sharp in the fifth octave tuned down to 0.500.


Chord Format:
[Note[+Note+...+Note]][Rest Modifiers] (Only up to four notes can be in a chord)
For example "c4+e4+g4+c5". A c-major chord.


Rests:
All chords by default are equal to a quater note or 1 beat.
Even if a chord has no notes or no rests it will be 1 beat.
For example c4. A chord equal with a rest to 1 beat.
Another example $. Another chord with a rest equal to 2 beats.

Rest Characters:
;	+1/4 beat
/	+1/2 beat
$	+1 beat
-	+2 beat
_	+3 beat
>	divides the chord's total rest value by 2
For example "c4$$$$". A chord with a rest equal to 5 beats.
Another example "c4_->/". A chord with a rest equal to 3.25 beats.

In the previous example you can see that despite the dividing symbol (>) being before one of the other modifiers.
It still only takes affect after all of them have been added together. Including the the +1/2 beat (/).
To keep the values of rests clear it is suggested to go from left to right the highest to lowest value beat modifiers and then any dividers if nescesary.


Phrases:
(Chord)[,Chord,...,Chord]
A phrase is just a collection of chords seperated by comma.
They are played in order and the next chord will wait until the previous chord's rest has finished before playing.

For the sake of making writing delays easier you can change the tempo of the phrase at any time.
You can change the timing in two ways:
t:BPM	changes the delay in beats per minute
d:Delay	changes the delay in milliseconds

To do this add a chord before containing a tempo modifier in it.
Keep in mind that this chord shouldn't contain any notes in it.
For example "t:200,c4,c3,c5,t:100,c4,c3,c5". A phrase that starts with the tempo at 200 bpm and changes it to 100 bpm later.
Tempo modifiers themselves do not add a rest so doing this will cause no issues with timing.


Songs:
(Phrase Number)[,Phrase Number,...,Phrase Number]
A list of phrases. These phrases are played in the order they are listed are referenced by the line they are on (starting at 0).
For example 
"
0,1,2
c3,c4,c5
e3,e4,e5
g3,g4,g5
". A song with three phrases. They are played in the order of first phrase second and then third.

If you want a song to loop infinetly add a % at the end of the last phrase in the song.
This will cause the song to start over at the begining and continue onto loop again.


Other Characters:
?	Plays a random note


File Format:
1.4.1	3
(Name)	(BLID)
(Song)

The file should be a txt file with the name of whatever song you're making.
I've found it much easier to use the file directly to write a song than it is using the gui.
Although the gui is still very useful for listening to what you wrote.


Exteneded Note Values:
These values can be used to go beyond the original range of octaves.
It takes adventage of the fact you are able to tune notes manually.
All of the extended notes are tuned from c for a very good reason.

You can even use this chart to speed up or slow down the instrumet's sound causing the note to player longer or shorter.

To use the chart look for the letter you want and replace x with the octave you want plus or minus whatever number is next to it.
For example if I wanted a c7 that would be using this entry "c6+1    c6:2".
Another example if I wanted to make a c4 play for as long as it can I would use this entry "c6-2	c6:0.250".
I picked this entry because 6-2 = 4 which is the octave I want and it is the lowest possible value for c4.
